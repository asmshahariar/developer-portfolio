            <P>I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS,<br> and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information<br> through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</P>
